       " ' I had the same problem that others on Amazon are having with this product (who likely left bad reviews as I\\\\m doing here right now). I just purchased this same filter from Walmart recently along with a brand new Brita water pitcher (yes both the filter and pitcher are new and compatible with each other...and the filter that came with the pitcher had the same issue as well). I thought I was crazy as to why quite a bit of the dirty water was leaking through the filter around the edges of where the filter sits flush with the pitcher housing; and watching the \\\\dirty\\\\ water drip around the actual filter and into the clean water reservoir I just cringed and scratched my head... After triple checking and making sure the filter was properly rotated so that it inserted into the unit all the way properly, I pushed so darn hard that I was ready for the unit to break, the filter looked flush with the water pitcher housing...and alas, water still leaks through and the filter clearly does NOT seal well with this unit. I find it almost humorous that I only came here to read these Amazon reviews describing the same exact issues after I decided to Google my problem and see if there was a magic solution, and I see Brita repeatedly replying with we\\\\re sorry! call our customer service and we will help!...or you need to insert the filter properly by lining it up and firmly pressing down. If you go onto Brita\\\\s website and look up their advanced water filters for sale and check out the customer reviews there, you will ALSO find more dissapointed customers complaining about the water filters not properly sealing and allowing dirty water to pass through...along with the same sad responses from Brita support which seemingly makes Brita look like they\\\\re being proactive. Unfortunately as in this case, sometime\\\\s replying with the same canned responses that don\\\\t really solve the problem is just as bad as no customer service or reply as well; clearly Brita is in denial or won\\\\t publicly accept fault for this issue. I think the worst part in all of this though, is that there are likely many consumers who get their new Brita and set it up and are excited or just used to the way their old Brita filters worked, and they don\\\\t even bother to look carefully and see whether or not any dirty water is getting through the filter because it doesn\\\\t seal properly/completely in a water-tight fashion within the water pitcher apparatus. So all of the great things Brita says about it keeping you and your family safe by filtering your water is somewhat misleading with product defects like this. You\\\\re buying a filter to clean your water, you don\\\\t even notice its NOT cleaning your water, and you go on happily and ignorantly drinking your slightly-less-dirty water that still has some contaminants in it because the filter doesn\\\\t seal well. The essential function function of a water filter like this is to filter ALL of the water, not just most of it...if the product can\\\\t filter 99.99999% of the water being poured into it, then it is most certainly a defective product. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Brita that they aren\\\\t purposely and knowingly selling a defective filter-design, it\\\\s still pretty apparent that they have a pretty high number of manufacturing defects going on where the plastic isn\\\\t lining up and providing a perfect seal between the water pitchers and advanced water filters. FYI, Brita Customer Service, if you respond to my message with anything less than something like you are correct, we apologize for selling a flawed product for some time now as evidenced by countless negative reviews, and we are in the works to create a new and better design that keeps the water filter tightly, properly, and easily sealed when inserted...then I know you haven\\\\t read or care about what I say or anyone else has been complaining about regarding this issue. No need for me to call Brita customer service either, I\\\\m going to buy a filter now from your competitor and I can only hope it works the way it should. Thanks for reading and please escalate this complaint to your CEO and COO and any other concerned parties who will actually take notice of this and resolve the problem without pushing it under the carpet.',\n",

       "' They tore up after a little over a year, and I\\\\m not very strong... Poor quality, also one of the handle got bent (but you can still work out with it). When they tear it can be painful, so I suggest if you must buy this brand, replace every year. What a waste of money, first off let me state that is product may work if you ever get it applied to he window. After multiple applications trying to center a giant sheet of Saran Wrap around super sticky tape I am probably qualified to fuel jets mid air. This product is beyond infuriating. Perhaps a team of 4 would have no issues. For us it did not work, we couldn\\\\t get tape to stick nor plastic to shrink. For us this wasn\\\\t a good buy and we needed up using duck tape lol The fire extinguisher was fully discharged upon opening the package. It was a mess. This is defective and does not work. It is unbelievable that defective safety equipment is being sold (still available for purchase!) and that more effort is not being made to warn people who bought it. Don\\\\t work I checked the product details and the packaging mine arrived in is different from what is advertised. The advertised packaging specifically says it is the only original U.S. packaging, and yet mine was completely different in shape, form, and design. This problem is in addition to the fact that the infuser displayed wear and tear symptomatic of use despite the fact that it was purchased new. It doesn\\\\t close properly and the loose leaf tea I use always comes out into the water and I have to pick a lot of it out. I will definitely be looking for a better one. Crap. When closed still has massive gaps so all but the largest tea pieces float out. Might as well dump loose leaf tea right into your water, it would be just as good. I bought to make large portions of loose leaf tea but the leaves fall out of the sides and into my tea so I rarely use it. Broke after a few uses. Very flimsy. Shipping was slow. Product did not work at all - I am very disappointed. Broke before it made it to my mug. small, very bad material don\\\\t even know if i got credit for a damaged product sent Broke after three uses handle separated from metal. On a mission to replace my last coffee bean grinder I spent considerable time reading reviews of the top-rated ones. I finally decided on this one. Big mistake. The KRUPS F203 does, indeed, grind coffee beans. But trying to transfer the grounds to oneâ??s coffee maker results in a huge mess. (I wouldnâ??t know but perhaps this highly rated grinder would be appropriate for grinding spices. But itâ??s way too messy for daily grinding of coffee beans.) Summary: I quit grinding coffee beans shortly after I started using this grinder. Thanks to this purchase, Iâ??m back to buying pre-ground coffee. Gimme my old grinder back! Recommendation: against all reviews, do not buy. This makes a huge mess! Coffee grinds everywhere. Need a brush to get them out. Grinds get compacted under the blades and will not come out unless you use a brush and then it becomes a mess. I am shopping for something else. Do NOT buy this! Yikes. The current model is made in China and fills the room with a very pungent electricity smell and does not have the power my old Krups Grinder had. DO NOT BUY After a couple of months doesn\\\\t grid beans well. Big pieces in grids. Bad! I had the same problem that others on Amazon are having with this product (who likely left bad reviews as I\\\\m doing here right now). I just purchased this same filter from Walmart recently along with a brand new Brita water pitcher (yes both the filter and pitcher are new and compatible with each other...and the filter that came with the pitcher had the same issue as well). I thought I was crazy as to why quite a bit of the dirty water was leaking through the filter around the edges of where the filter sits flush with the pitcher housing; and watching the \\\\dirty\\\\ water drip around the actual filter and into the clean water reservoir I just cringed and scratched my head... After triple checking and making sure the filter was properly rotated so that it inserted into the unit all the way properly, I pushed so darn hard that I was ready for the unit to break, the filter looked flush with the water pitcher housing...and alas, water still leaks through and the filter clearly does NOT seal well with this unit. I find it almost humorous that I only came here to read these Amazon reviews describing the same exact issues after I decided to Google my problem and see if there was a magic solution, and I see Brita repeatedly replying with we\\\\re sorry! call our customer service and we will help!...or you need to insert the filter properly by lining it up and firmly pressing down. If you go onto Brita\\\\s website and look up their advanced water filters for sale and check out the customer reviews there, you will ALSO find more dissapointed customers complaining about the water filters not properly sealing and allowing dirty water to pass through...along with the same sad responses from Brita support which seemingly makes Brita look like they\\\\re being proactive. Unfortunately as in this case, sometime\\\\s replying with the same canned responses that don\\\\t really solve the problem is just as bad as no customer service or reply as well; clearly Brita is in denial or won\\\\t publicly accept fault for this issue. I think the worst part in all of this though, is that there are likely many consumers who get their new Brita and set it up and are excited or just used to the way their old Brita filters worked, and they don\\\\t even bother to look carefully and see whether or not any dirty water is getting through the filter because it doesn\\\\t seal properly/completely in a water-tight fashion within the water pitcher apparatus. So all of the great things Brita says about it keeping you and your family safe by filtering your water is somewhat misleading with product defects like this. You\\\\re buying a filter to clean your water, you don\\\\t even notice its NOT cleaning your water, and you go on happily and ignorantly drinking your slightly-less-dirty water that still has some contaminants in it because the filter doesn\\\\t seal well. The essential function function of a water filter like this is to filter ALL of the water, not just most of it...if the product can\\\\t filter 99.99999% of the water being poured into it, then it is most certainly a defective product. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Brita that they aren\\\\t purposely and knowingly selling a defective filter-design, it\\\\s still pretty apparent that they have a pretty high number of manufacturing defects going on where the plastic isn\\\\t lining up and providing a perfect seal between the water pitchers and advanced water filters. FYI, Brita Customer Service, if you respond to my message with anything less than something like you are correct, we apologize for selling a flawed product for some time now as evidenced by countless negative reviews, and we are in the works to create a new and better design that keeps the water filter tightly, properly, and easily sealed when inserted...then I know you haven\\\\t read or care about what I say or anyone else has been complaining about regarding this issue. No need for me to call Brita customer service either, I\\\\m going to buy a filter now from your competitor and I can only hope it works the way it should. Thanks for reading and please escalate this complaint to your CEO and COO and any other concerned parties who will actually take notice of this and resolve the problem without pushing it under the carpet. fits better ..... Water taste exactly like that comes out of the rap which is awful. Shame,I\\\\ve been a happy customer for many years. Was messed up in the box. Wouldn\\\\t recomment! AND it doesn\\\\t filter out lead! did not work on camping trip, tried to filter my urinne to make clean water. how do i apply for a refund? I bought this product because I knew it would be far healthier than microwave popcorn. It scratched the hell out of my stovetop with one use. I never moved the pan, just twirled. The bottom of the pan appeared to not be flat. It wobbled all over the burner. Don\\\\t buy this product if you value you stove. DOES NOT HAVE WEIGHT AND IS NOT STURDY AT ALL!! I used this thermometer on a beautiful cut of brisket in the smoker. It was taking longer than it should have to reach temperature for the proper smoking time. I used the old fashioned analog thermometer to find out I had over cooked it by 15 degrees. I was left with a delicious shoe. Like others have said, this arrived damaged. It was badly dented and the metal was flaking off. I actually got a sliver when I ran my hand over it. This is a poor quality product. The new first response tests are awful. Please go back to the old ones. Last month I got 4 positive tests on the new ones, and I wasn\\\\t pregnant, it was very sad since I have been ttc. The kids don\\\\t go on as easy as normal Pyrex. All sizes as quite small for the price Lid melted in the microwave first time being cooked. Pass on these... Bad quality lids, can not withstand the heat in the microwave. Loved this product when I bought it last year when I had to buy a new one I was excited. Truly was an amazing product. However I\\\\m not sure if something has changed with the stuffing or what but this pillow now gives me terrible headaches. I can\\\\t use it at all. What a huge waste of $! Too hard and too big. I would love it if it will allow me to use my own pillow, but it\\\\s too big and I have to use it as my pillow, but it is too hard and high for me, makes my neck stiff in the morning. I really hate it! So uncomfortable - and too big! RETURNED Difficult to put on. impossible for me! Needs larger opening possibly with zipper or velcreo item was bent and didn\\\\t work. Had to go to Bed & bath to get a good one. Now I need to reorder. Disappointed by quality of popcorn after it was popped. Popcorn had weird chemical smell. I will be returning this product. this made the worsts popcorn ever. Threw it out!! This waffle iron was intended to replace another Cuisinart waffle iron that died before its time. I have seen a noticeable decline in the quality of Cuisinart over the last few years, and the company hasnâ??t stood behind their product as they once did. Up until now, though, Iâ??ve remained loyal to the brand. Right out of the box, I noticed that this waffle ironâ??s top was not adequately attached, and did not align with the bottom. I also found fault with the control knob, which was extremely loose. So the waffle iron is being returned and Iâ??m on a quest to find a better waffle iron. Didnâ??t even plug it in! It smells up the house with a plastic smell. So we eat waffles and can\\\\t breathe. WE DO NOT LIKE IT AT ALL. How these get such high reviews is beyond me. Look at the hundreds of postings here about filter failure! The quality control on these is terrible. About 1 in 5 filters has the issue where it locks up and very little water goes through and often no water will go through when the level is below the holes at the apex of the filter head. You will read about the trick to agitate the filter through the side port holes at the bottom of the filter - but this usually only works temporarily and then the filter fails again requiring more fiddling. This issue is so pervasive and clearly ignored by Pur that I\\\\m surprised there has not been a class action against the company. I have been using PUR since last year. The first few filters worked well. Each of them could last 2 month or so. And I never seen clog up problem before I replaced them. Recently, I got serious problem with purchased PUR filters. None of them could last more than two weeks and it started to clog up. At first, the filtered water was slow, then I completely stopped flowing. I tried several ways to \\\\save\\\\ it as suggested by PUR. Like shake it well, reversely flush with water, soak it etc. None of them worked. A new filter works normally but it starts passing water gradually slowly after 1 week. When I follow 2 tips suggested by PUR, it passes faster a little bit, but after 1-2 refills in my dispenser, the issue happens again. I contacted the customer service and they sent me 3 other filters as replacement but there was no difference. Note that I used Brita prior to PUR and had no such problem. One worked. One was SUPER slow. The one I opened today was WET when I opened the package. Wet. Yes...Wet. Why would it be wet? Was it used and repackaged? Who knows. A better home protection weapon than cooking utensil. This skillet is the reason they invented Teflon. I followed the directions, made sure to season, and it created a MESS. Apparently, the previous reviews are written by folks with interest in the company. Sometimes you live and learn you dont believe everything on the internet. This trimmer was so bad. It misses my beard as I trim in a line. I have go back and forth a few times for it to work. The charger started getting loose connection. Literarily the only thing good was the you could use it while charging. SO don\\\\t buy it. Awful batteries. I had to throw them all away and Amazon didn\\\\t give me an option to get my money back. I have used Duracell batteries for years and won\\\\t even use other brands. I\\\\ve purchased different types of Duracell batteries and I think these pro series must be the bottom of the barrel. I use batteries for on-site flash photography and was able to only get about half the clicks with this series. I won\\\\t be purchasing these again. I\\\\ll head back to Costco for theirs --- much more dependable. These batteries are not the duracell we know and love. some kind of knock off? I don\\\\t know but have gone through a pack of 24 in less than a month with 2 little race cars. Don\\\\t last at all!!!! Seems half used. Don\\\\t work as expected of Duracell. Great looking when it comes out 9of the box, only problem is the magnets do not stick to our aluminum outlets. Had to put double-sided velcro on it.Whether or not it\\\\s unbreakable we will find out after it runs with the furnace for a while. Can\\\\t expect much for six bucks but it should at least have an alternate way of attachment. The magnets on one of the sets I purchased do not work. I have GERD. My doctor recommended I try Prilosec before using a prescription medication. It made my heartburn worse. Coffee spills every time we use it. The package is different. The color of the toner water is yellowish, which supposes to be clear. Suspicious quality. I just received the Rose Petal Witch Hazel in the new bottle. (purchased from a different site) I\\\\ve been using this product for years and am sorely disappointed in this new version. I thought that only the bottle had been changed, but clearly the formula itself has been altered. Comparing the old versus the new side by side, there are dramatic differences. The old has a wonderful rose scent, the new smells like soap. The old has a very silky caressing texture when applied to the face, the new feels almost astringent and leaves the skin tacky. Why in the world would you want to change something that worked so beautifully. This means I can no longer trust any of your other products either... will really miss the cucumber, also. What a shame... Claims to moisturize and reduce acne, so I bought this for my (very oily) face and used it at night on my entire face. When I woke up I had a huge red, raw stretch of skin from the corners of my mouth to the bottom of my chin. Days later this patch of skin is not only still very very dry and red, but it is also peeling and forming far more pimples than usual. If you have ever experienced any level of skin sensitivity I would not recommend this product, as my skin isn\\\\t really that sensitive and I don\\\\t have any allergies. I receive different not like what showing in photo I do not recommend this product at all. Horrible for skin Received the toner, but the bottle is different with that I purchased before. The bottle is leeking, which looks like fake product. I will return. Haven\\\\t tried the product yet but it came with the label half torn off and a large sticker covering the rest of it. Almost tempted to send back. Works great, except for two big issues. First, its incredibly difficult to shut off from the spin position. I\\\\m talking makes your skin raw. I\\\\ve resorted to using something rigid to click it off. I think this happens because the switch you use to release the bag is the power switch, and basically when you have it in the roller position the switch is wedged in as far as it will go. (and I don\\\\t think its just a case of me being weak as I am a 33 year old male whose is a recreational rock climber) My second issue is the brush roller. 90% of the time it does not work for me. I have tried cleaning the roller off multiple times. Basically the trick I use to get it to work is to just smack the side of the roller on the ground, hard. After enough hits, it works again! I will not be buying another one. inconvenient to use. gotta lift the relatively bulky thing whenever i gotta clean. so a quick cleaning job turns into a mini project. because it\\\\s not cordless. the wire is long but still. Plastic garbage. It works great (very loud, though) for a few months and then fails to be of any use. Stay away. The Eureka EasyClean vacuum quit working soon after purchasing it. These thermo cubes are junk, I purchased two of the on at 35 off at 45 TC-3 model. They both turned on at 25 and off at 30 so I wrote to farm innovators who never responded. I then called the thermo cube company who sent me one for free and that one did the same thing. I threw all 3 in the trash.... Additionally the receptacles in the cube are very hard to plug into and remove..... I have bought 20 or more of these since 2010 and all of them have not worked after a few days out in the cold. I would not buy another unless they have a guarantee of at least two years. I thought they would get better with technology, but they have not. I purchased two of these. One for a small heater in my well pump house and the second one just to be safe. Neither of them worked. First one didn\\\\t work, got a replacement and that one also didn\\\\t work. Junk. Ground prong loose and didn\\\\t work. Cheap construction. Wont turn off as described. Sending back never did =work This product does not hold many stuffed animals and it doesn\\\\t stretch out very wide. The photo is very deceiving. I purchased two and threw both of ours away. Did not work well and did not detect anything. Ate up battery after one use. We have used our veggie slicer twice, both times with fun results. However, the reason for the low rating this that on the second use, one of the metal grater teeth broke off! Thankfully we caught it before cooking and serving the veggies but beware! I will be requesting a refund. Terrible cheap product. Wish I hadn\\\\t bought it. This was a gift fr my daughter and broke the first time she tried to use it. Dead on arrival! Batteries were dead,no display obviously.so I\\\\m not sure if the stupid thing works at all. Tried 4 stores to replace the batteries; surprise! They didn\\\\t carry them. Really? I just tossed the thing to the far corner of the garage. Bought this in July and it worked once fine. Tried it again in December and it is totally dead. Very disappointing. This broke after one use. Actually, less than one use! It broke in the middle of the very first use! Disappointed. Don\\\\t be drawn in by claims on this one. Absolutely awful l to try to drink and not worth it! really bad and nasty flavour I received these pens yesterday, I have spent the last hour using them for a picture that required fine ink lines, and in that hour the 005, the 02 and the 03 have stopped working, and ink is leaking out of the tip of the 005 so badly that it is unusable, as none of the ink is actually coming out of the tip. Considering how lightly these pens have been used in the hour that I have been using them, they are absolutely not worth the price, or the hassle of cleaning leaked ink off of everything, including the now ruined art piece. Wow, this stuff is so sticky i can barely get it out of the jar. I use very little, too. Clumps in my hair, which is short and fine. Smells a bit like a baby product. Maybe it works for really thick hair if you use a butter knife to get it out...but not for me. Not what I thought We bought these replacement batteries and quickly found out that they don\\\\t last very long. Just replaced one and it only lasted a week! This is unacceptable. I\\\\ve bought batteries before and they have lasted months. PetSafe you need to watch your quality control. No issues with the seller but the capsules just didn\\\\t work for me unfortunately. I took them for about 4 days 2 to 3 times a day and saw no difference. I will be trying mothers milk or something else soon Biggest piece of granola!worked great for about one minute, then nothing. Don\\\\t waste your money. They won\\\\t give you a refund. Bought the 25ft extension cord too. Stuck with it too. I accidentally bought these. While I didn\\\\t use them during the winter ice/snow they were horrible. I removed right away as they streaked and made noise. Bought 5 of these wipers and every one of them streak and do not wipe right Ugliest wiper blades ever and it leaves streaks on the window. I hate it. DO NOT BUY. Not impressed. They have red tips and a slime coated rubber cover Doesn\\\\t clean well, half of the blade won\\\\t keep contact with the glass. Supposed to be size to fit wiper arm purchased. Too long. CAUTION !!!! This does not fit all GRAND CARAVAN rear wipers. Mine had a plastic wiper arm and broke trying to install this thing. I later noticed the obvious difference in the width of the ring where the clip slides into. It\\\\s really hard to find the wiper arm and it costs over $80. To make things worse, I threw away the box as soon as I got it and I can\\\\t even return it now. Thanks amazon for telling me its a fit to my car with nice large green fonts. That was helpful...NOT. DO NOT BUY. Leaks battery acid. Was leaking when I got them. Trying to get refund appears impossible. Loss of money. these weren\\\\t oral B as advertised. Very different brush head. Deceptive advertising. Didn\\\\t know. But this stuff is worthless now. Because ethanol 10% degrades gas anyway within 30 days. So no matter what you use. The molecule will still come apart and mess up your carb. This won\\\\t help. First, a caveat: I bought this thinking it might be an effective tool for scraping barnacles off the bottom of my rowboat -- after all, I didn\\\\t think it could be any more challenging than scraping ice from a windshield. Not sure if this represented valid reasoning on my part, but the fact is, this item failed almost immediately. For some reason, the designers thought it would be better to have small, individual plastic scraping surfaces on the working end rather than a single, stout blade. As such, these little fingers started breaking off almost immediately and I ended up just throwing the scraper away after a frustrating first use. Probably fine if you\\\\re just pushing loose snow off your windshield; otherwise, I\\\\d look for something better. This is NOT a serious scraper by any stretch. I have been using this steamer for only 6 months and it blows out steam on and off. Some days it works and some it days it doesn\\\\t. When it does work, I can only get one shirt done because it quickly stops working. Very, very disappointed. 0 stars, doesn\\\\t work at all!! Refund please cause shipping might cost as a new one of these! trowing money away. Fuzzy almost useless. Does not work. Very upset !!! I was looking for something like this on my mechanic\\\\s recommendation because my work/home/errands radius is very small, and the battery was not getting fully charged. After reading all the reviews, I thought that this was the best that we could do. However, within 20 minutes of installing it in my car, we smelled smoke and ran down to see this device on fire. The sound insulation under the hood consequently caught on fire, and burned through the hood, and bits of burning insulation fell into the engine block. This was one of the most frightening things we\\\\ve every experienced, and we were in complete shock and had to put the fire out ourselves. Had we left this unattended and left the house, our entire house would have been up in smoke, particularly because our carport is under the house. The manufacturer passed us onto his insurer, who is stalling on paying our repair costs, saying that it was user error. Use this device at your own risk! I am reporting this device to the local and Federal consumer protection agencies, and am fighting the insurance company to get the body damage on my car repaired. Take a look of the photos I\\\\ve attached, and you can see the positive connection completely blackened and melted, and the damage it did to my hood. This item should last longer than 6 uses over three years. Just quit in December 2015, purchased Feb 2013. Warranty is basically worthless - check reports on line. Appears company doesn\\\\t stand behind their product. I\\\\ll go to a NOCO and try that instead This product was bundled together with An ultrasonic humidifier I purchased at the same time as a frequently bought together add-on item. The print is so small on the back of the bottle it is very hard to even read. So I put it in my ultrasonic humidifier in my bedroom and it made me cough so much I had to turn it off. Thought I was going to die, I could not hardly breather and had to leave the room for hours. Next morning I get my magnifying glass and read that this product is TOXIC to humans and domestic animals! And DO NOT USE with ULTRASONIC humidifiers or Vaporizers...omg I also had my 3 dogs in the bedroom with me..I am so angry I did not/could not read the back of this product before I used it! Not a good product. The bottom part threads into the top part but does not completely seal causing steam to escape. The Moka (coffee) sticks on the upper sieve which blocks the steam from going in the upper part. This raises the temperature of the the whole Stovetop causing even more steam escaping and a very hot Stovetop to a dangerous level. It looked very attractive before first use but only after first use it looked unbelievably ugly. A cheap product. I did not realize I was buying the 2 ounce, it says one cup but is actually 1/2 cup with a measure cup, when I received this I thought it was a toy ! I know I should have read the description better, what a waste of my money and time, how about putting a ruler next to picture or show all 3 sizes side by side. material changed and effect so easy. couple usage and alum. rusted. However taste is crazy unbelievable really good. for taste i gave hounded star but material deserve no star'"
